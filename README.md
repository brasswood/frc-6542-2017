Technomancers Repo For FIRST Steamworks 2017 Code

# Cloning this repository for Eclipse
1. In git bash, cd to the parent directory of your local repository directory. (For example, if I wanted the repository directory to be `/home/andrew/frc-6542-2017`, I would type `cd /home/andrew`.) I recommend putting your local repository directory in your home folder or username folder.
2. Enter `git clone https://github.com/brasswood/frc-6542-2017/`
3. Now, open Eclipse. In the menu bar click File > Import
4. In the window that opens, expand 'Git', select 'Projects from Git', and click next.
5. Select 'Existing local repository', click next.
6. Click 'Add...', and browse to the directory you cloned the repository to. (Using my example from step 1, I would select `/home/andrew/frc-6542-2017`.)
7. Make sure the repository is selected in the 'Search Results' portion of the window, and click finish.
8. Select the repository, and click next.
9. Select 'Import existing Eclipse projects', and below select the 'Working Tree' folder. Click next.
10. Make sure your project is selected. Click Finish.
